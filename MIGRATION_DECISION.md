# MIGRATION_DECISION

## Decision
No framework migration is required.

## Rationale
- The project is already running on **Vite + React + TypeScript**, which satisfies the architecture requirement for a modern toolchain.
- The redesign work focuses on content architecture, design tokens, and component refactoring rather than build-system replacement.
- Keeping Vite avoids unnecessary migration risk and preserves build simplicity for static deployment.
