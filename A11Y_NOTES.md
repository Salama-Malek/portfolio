# Accessibility Notes

- All navigational and CTA interactions are keyboard reachable via semantic `<a>` controls.
- A consistent `:focus-visible` ring is applied to links, inputs, and textareas.
- Major page areas preserve semantic landmarks (`header`, `main`, `section`, `footer`).
- Motion transitions are subtle and are disabled for users with reduced-motion preferences.
- Form fields include visible labels and avoid placeholder-only identification.
- Color usage keeps a high-contrast text-first hierarchy on dark surfaces.
